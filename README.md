# Signals & Systems Simulations

This repository contains MATLAB-based simulations and analyses for three key homework assignments in signals & systems. Each homework explores different aspects of signal processing, system behavior, and sampling theory, using both theoretical and practical approaches.

## Homework 1: Fourier Series Analysis and Music Note Generation

This homework focuses on the Fourier series and its applications in signal decomposition and reconstruction. Key tasks include:

- **Fourier Coefficients Calculation**: Finding and analyzing the Fourier coefficients for different signals.
- **Music Note Generation**: Using windowing techniques to generate and compare musical tones.
- **Signal Comparisons**: Exploring the effects of windowing on different time-domain signals and observing the corresponding frequency-domain characteristics.

## Homework 2: Laplace Transform and Transfer Function Analysis

This homework explores the Laplace domain for analyzing control systems, specifically focusing on transfer functions. Major components include:

- **Transfer Function Representation**: Defining transfer functions using MATLAB and analyzing system dynamics.
- **Pole-Zero Mapping**: Plotting the poles and zeros of the transfer function to study system stability.
- **Inverse Laplace Transform**: Calculating and interpreting the inverse Laplace transform of complex systems.

## Homework 3: Sampling Theorem and Audio Processing

This homework examines key concepts of digital signal processing, including sampling theory and its application to audio signals. Key tasks include:

- **Sampling and Aliasing**: Understanding Nyquist criteria, performing downsampling, and analyzing the effects of aliasing on sampled signals.
- **Audio Resampling**: Manipulating audio signals by upsampling and downsampling, and evaluating the resulting audio quality and spectral content.
- **Fourier Analysis of Audio Signals**: Applying FFT and visualizing the frequency spectrum of audio files.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2023 or later.
